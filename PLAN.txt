requirements
incrementally follow signposting to retrieve linked data
load into knowledge graph
execute explorative queries on the linked data
select which resources to follow next 
allow for heuristic fallback when no signposting available
logic that dertermines when to stop crawl and how to select sources of interest
deposit knowledge graph with associated provenance/origin

additional features:
linked data embedded in HTML
FAIR  evaluation

Features todo list:
Store signposting in Graph
Recursion steps:
    fetch signposts
    loop through signposts with handler functions
    check if signpost target is crawlable
    create graph
    return graph

alternative option with loop
    while true:
        fetch signposts from url[i] 
        handler func for signposts/linksets
            fetch the data
            add data to graph[i]
            check if target is crawlable
            if crawlable add url to stack
