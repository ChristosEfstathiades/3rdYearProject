incrementally follow signposting to retrieve linked data
load into knowledge graph
execute explorative queries on the linked data
select which resources to follow next 
allow for heuristic fallback when no signposting available
logic that dertermines when to stop crawl and how to select sources of interest
deposit knowledge graph with associated provenance/origin

additional features:
linked data embedded in HTML
FAIR  evaluation


ideas:
maybe change describedby subjects to the describedby targets 

graph visualization:
pyvis
cytoscape

possible heiristics:
described by links
predicates
HTML
